# Deep Positional Encoders (DPE) For Graph Classification

This repository contains the official implementation of "Deep Positional Encoders For Graph Classification" paper. DPE introduces a novel learnable positional encoding approach that enhances GNN expressiveness beyond the Weisfeiler-Lehman test limitations.

## Overview

DPE bridges the gap between Deep Learning and Spectral Graph Theory by introducing learnable positional encoders that:
- Enhance GNN expressiveness beyond WL test limitations  
- Scale linearly with graph size
- Avoid computational burden of explicit eigendecompositions
- Maintain theoretical benefits of Spectral Graph Theory
